# Password Generator

## The Task:

* I have been tasked with creating Javascript code to generate a random password from a specific set of characters. The password must be more than 10 but no more than 64 characters in lenght.

**Instructions**

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Installation

To run, simply open the following link in your Chrome web browser. Once open, enter a number between 10-64, and select from the following options to include specific characters in your randomly generated password:

• Lowercase characters
• Uppercase characters
• numeric characters
• special symbols

Once you have selected the options you require, the password will be displayed on the screen. To start the process again, refresh your browser and continue as before.
